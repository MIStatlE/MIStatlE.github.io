### About Me
I'm a researcher exploring the **theory of learning and optimization** — probability, convex analysis, and reinforcement learning.  
I enjoy building **mathematical bridges** between abstract theory and practical intelligence.

Outside research, I’m passionate about writing, design, and creating **public learning ecosystems** that empower others to grow.
